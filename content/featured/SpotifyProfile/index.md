I am actively engaged in conducting experiments and corrosion testing on magnesium alloys, replicating conditions similar to the human body. The primary goal is to assess corrosion rates and tensile strength, with a specific focus on evaluating their potential for orthopedic applications, including the fabrication of wires into stents and their incorporation into cables for sternal closures.
